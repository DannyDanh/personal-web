        I am Danh Nguyen, a Computer Science student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick with minors in Data Science, Mathematics, and Quantitative Finance. Passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering, I thrive on solving complex problems through data-driven insights. Currently, I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant at AIOS (AI Agent Operating System), where I contribute to enhancing AI agent capabilities and benchmarking performance. Beyond research, I have experience in IT consulting, peer reviewing academic research, and teaching physics. I am always eager to explore new opportunities in AI, data science, and analytics engineering, and I enjoy collaborating with others to drive innovation.
